              Dark clouds look over the house, and the world outside my window is wrapped in the mysteries of the mist. It's an ordinary Saturday morning on December 15th 2022, in Pangbisa, Paro Bhutan. Just as I turn over, the clock reads 6:50a.m., -3℃, and I hear those familiar shuffling footsteps that have become a personalised alarm for my brain. Before my mother calls me, I emerge from my room to find her, wearing a broad smile, headed over to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. I quickly cover myself with a blanket rolled on the sofa before the cold in the living room penetrates through my layers. I find my father, focused on getting the fire started with a t-shirt and a pyjama, barely taking notice of the cold. I wave to him good morning and disappear into the washroom for a while.

            <br>
            <p>

              By the time I come out, the living room is pleasant, and the warm hue emanating from the fireplace creates a beautiful gradient with the muted grey from the window. I follow the distant rhythmic thudding – the sound of the sword striking the wooden stump used for cutting the dried beef <i>[shakam]</i> into edible bites. Approaching the kitchen, I gag on the spice from the smell of burning chilli and tomatoes. As I near the steaming pot, my glasses fog and I barely manage to plop down a chunk of butter into the already-brewed tea leaves and start revving the mixture to get my part of the job done. The whiff of butter melting into the black tea, mingling with the smell of almost cooked rice, and the spice from the burnt chilli and freshly cut onion make my mouth water. It feels like 'home'.

            <br>
            <p>
              My mother beckons me, <i>"Bumchu! Thali toenshi [little girl, set the plates]."</i> With each breakfast element converging around the hearth, a vivid tableau of a perfect Bhutanese breakfast takes shape. <i>Apa</i>[father], Mummy, <i>Ashim</i>[older sister] and I seated cross-legged on the floor, circling a vessel holding steaming white rice, a brimming kettle of rich butter tea, a bowl full of shakam, and a wooden mortar and pestle filled with homemade chilli paste<i>[ezzay]</i>. Like any typical Bhutanese household, my mother starts to pass around plates piled with a mound of white rice. She begins with <i>Apa</i>, <i>Ashim</i>, myself and then finally herself. Meanwhile, my sister starts serving the tea in the same order my mother passed around the plates, except she passes a cup of tea to Mummy right after she offers one to <i>Apa</i>; the eldest in the family are served first and, subsequently, we pass around dishes in order of our age. I pass the bowl of <i>shakam</i> to <i>Apa</i>. As the meal slowly unfolded, hands started darting around, and so did we untie all the knots in our hearts.

            <p>
              <i>"Naba nim sha ni mae, lunch pizza chi zaa wa jo gae mo</i> [The sun will be out tomorrow, so we should go get pizza for lunch]," my father suggests as he nonchalantly tosses over a few selected pieces of shakam to each one of us.<i>"Ngomara ya </i>[really]," I reconfirm before I let my eight-year-old self – who had only seen pizza in Doraemon commercial breaks – jump with excitement.

              Saturday morning breakfasts hadn't always been this way. When both my parents were civil servants, my mother resided in the capital city, two hours away from where my father was settled. I spent most of my time with my mother, and a cup of milk sufficed as breakfast;  shakam was reserved for special days on family gatherings such as this ordinary morning of December 15th,2022, at Pangbisa. After my mother quit her job and moved in with my father, the gloomy weather outside never set the stage at home, and shakam found a place on our table more often. In fact, grey shifting clouds and drizzles seem warm and gentle at Pangbisa, a place I now call home that transcends the physical bricks and moulds my sense of belongingness, happiness and love.

              After seeing a mixture of red, green, black and white on my plate, I set it on my lap. I immediately feel the heat from the plate rush into my legs, and it almost feels too hot. However, it only plays with my senses to quickly fill my stomach with hot food. As a dish best enjoyed when eaten bare hands, I take a small portion of rice from my plate and make a rice mould. I then place a small piece of the shakam and a dollop of <i>ezzay</i> on my white rice canvas. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              As I devour the whole rice canvas in one bite, the excitement from the pizza conversation is engulfed by the rainbow of flavours that burst in my mouth; the spice from the chilli and onion is balanced by the taste of the rice, and the shakam ensures we get the best out of these flavours as we gnaw on the hardness. <i>"Mummy, choe ghi croissant dhi ju ra ju wong </i>[Mummy, your croissant will surely sell well]," I gurgle my words as we generate silly ideas about opening the perfect cafe in Paro town. I then tried a different method of eating rice with the ezzay and then eating the piece of shakam. All the ingredients are the same, but the sequence of how we devour the food transforms the whole taste. <i>"Dae lae karaoke dhi Apa ghi go din thab wong</i> [And Dad can take over the karaoke stage]," my sister, as always, makes us laugh as we know about <i>Apa's</i> secret obsession with singing that never ventures beyond our walls. The conversation continues until we finally start passing around the last piece of shakam in the bowl. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Passing around the last piece of <i>shakam</i>, is not a practice, but it is done every once in a while. As we passed on the piece of <i>shakam</i>, that mundane entity would make us look each other in the eye, unravelling an ocean of love and selflessness; none of us were willing to take the last piece in case someone else would enjoy it more than us. This moment is a sign of passing around love and affection. We would pass around the last piece of shakam, and more often than not, it ended up being devoured by our dog, Lucky. These are the moments where it isn't merely about the food's appetising taste, but the food's preparation process and the people we sit together to share that meal that weaves a colourful fabric we call home.

              Even after we finish eating, it is only at lunchtime that we are able to begin our day. The cackling from the fireplace continues into the day as the ladies start to clean up and prepare lunch while the men – <i>Apa</i> being the only man – prepare their arrows and bows that will be used for the annual archery match. Being a part of this routine is an experience that shapes a part of what I now understand to be home.

              It's been a month since I started weaving my version of home at Colby. On a typical morning, September 23rd, 2023, I wake to golden light filtering through the blinds. It's 10:03a.m., and messages from various club group chats flood my phone. Another exciting day awaits. After washing up, my roommate and I head towards Dana, our favourite dining place, for brunch. The crisp fall air that gushes through my hoodie reminds me of the cold of the December 15th morning in 2022, "This cold screams for a hot cup of coffee," my roommate says, mirroring my thoughts. As we enter Dana, the baked dough and sizzling butter aroma fills our lungs. We are greeted by both familiar and new faces, all bustling about. Despite the chaos, the lady at the counter greets each of us with a wide smile.

              In our routine developed over the past month, my roommate and I find our spot, leave our phones and key cards on the table, and gather our plates, forks and spoons. Like a delivery man, we go from one counter to another to gather the perfect elements to perfect our brunch. As I set my plate on the table, the grilled BBQ chicken, cucumber, lettuce, carrots, and broccoli with ranch dressing, all caroused by the two large slices of pepperoni pizza, create the most colourful plate yet. As we start devouring the food, we plan a cooking activity where I will make her the perfect butter tea on a cold and dark day. With this, my spontaneous routine at Colby begins; it feels like 'home'. The home I have created at Colby is similar yet different to my home at Pangbisa. It is a little more adventurous and daunting but all the more exciting. Yet again, I find myself in another place filled with people I know will pass around the last piece of shakam and add another vibrant colour to my home fabric.
